    <p><span className="dropCap">W</span>hat is true is already so.  <br />
      Owning up to it doesn’t make it worse.  <br />
      Not being open about it doesn’t make it go away.  <br />
      And because it’s true, it is what is there to be interacted with.  <br />
      Anything untrue isn’t there to be lived.  <br />
      People can stand what is true,  <br />
      for they are already enduring it.</p>
