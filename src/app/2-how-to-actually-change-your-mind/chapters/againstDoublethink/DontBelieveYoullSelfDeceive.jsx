    <p><span className="dropCap">I</span> don’t mean to seem like I’m picking on Kurige, but I think you have to expect a certain amount of questioning if you show up on <em>Less Wrong</em> and say:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>One thing I’ve come to realize that helps to explain the disparity I feel when I talk with most other Christians is the fact that somewhere along the way my world-view took a major shift away from blind faith and landed somewhere in the vicinity of Orwellian double-think.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>“If you <em>know</em> it’s double-think…</p>
    <p>… how can you still believe it?” I helplessly want to say.</p>
    <p>Or:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>I chose to believe in the existence of God—deliberately and consciously. This decision, however, has absolutely zero effect on the actual existence of God.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If you <em>know</em> your belief isn’t correlated to reality, how can you still believe it?</p>
    <p>Shouldn’t the <em>gut-level</em> realization, “Oh, wait, the sky really <em>isn’t</em> green” follow from the realization “My map that says ‘the sky is green’ has no reason to be correlated with the territory”?</p>
    <p>Well… apparently not.</p>
    <p>One part of this puzzle may be my explanation of Moore’s Paradox (“It’s raining, but I don’t believe it is”)—that people introspectively mistake positive affect attached to a quoted belief, for actual credulity.</p>
    <p>But another part of it may just be that—contrary to the indignation I initially wanted to put forward—it’s actually quite <em>easy</em> not to make the jump from “The map that reflects the territory would say ‘<em>X</em>’ ” to actually believing “<em>X</em>.” It takes some work to <em>explain</em> the ideas of minds as map-territory correspondence builders, and even then, it may take more work to get the implications on a <em>gut level</em>.</p>
    <p>I realize now that when I wrote “You cannot make yourself believe the sky is green by an act of will,” I wasn’t just a dispassionate reporter of the existing facts. I was also trying to instill a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
    <p>It may be wise to go around deliberately repeating “I can’t get away with double-thinking! Deep down, I’ll know it’s not true! If I know my map has no reason to be correlated with the territory, that means I don’t believe it!”</p>
    <p>Because that way—if you’re ever tempted to try—the thoughts “But I know this isn’t really true!” and “I can’t fool myself!” will always rise readily to mind; and that way, you will indeed be less likely to fool yourself successfully. You’re more likely to get, on a gut level, that telling yourself <em>X</em> doesn’t make <em>X</em> true: and therefore, really truly not-<em>X</em>.</p>
    <p>If you keep telling yourself that you <em>can’t</em> just deliberately choose to believe the sky is green—then you’re less likely to succeed in fooling yourself on one level or another; either in the sense of really believing it, or of falling into Moore’s Paradox, belief in belief, or belief in self-deception.</p>
    <p>If you keep telling yourself that deep down you’ll know—</p>
    <p>If you keep telling yourself that you’d just look at your elaborately constructed false map, and just know that it was a false map without any expected correlation to the territory, and therefore, despite all its elaborate construction, you wouldn’t be able to invest any credulity in it—</p>
    <p>If you keep telling yourself that reflective consistency will take over and make you stop believing on the object level, once you come to the meta-level realization that the map is not reflecting—</p>
    <p>Then when push comes to shove—you may, indeed, fail.</p>
    <p>When it comes to deliberate self-deception, you must <em>believe in your own inability!</em></p>
    <p>Tell yourself the effort is doomed—<em>and it will be!</em></p>
    <p>Is that the power of positive thinking, or the power of negative thinking? Either way, it seems like a wise precaution.</p>
