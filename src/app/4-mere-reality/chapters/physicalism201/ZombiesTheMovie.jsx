    <p><span className="dropCap">F</span>ade in around a serious-looking group of uniformed military officers. At the head of the table, a senior, heavy-set man, General Fred, speaks.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: The reports are confirmed. New York has been overrun… by <em>zombies</em>.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: Again? But we just had a zombie invasion 28 days ago!</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: These zombies… are different. They're… <em>philosophical</em> zombies.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: Are they filled with rage, causing them to bite people?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: Do they lose all capacity for reason?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: No. They behave… <em>exactly</em> like we do… except that they're not conscious.</p>
    <p><em>(Silence grips the table.)</em></p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: Dear God.</p>
    <p>General Fred moves over to a computerized display.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: This is New York City, two weeks ago.</p>
    <p>The display shows crowds bustling through the streets, people eating in restaurants, a garbage truck hauling away trash.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: <em>This</em>... is New York City... <em>now</em>.</p>
    <p>The display changes, showing a crowded subway train, a group of students laughing in a park, and a couple holding hands in the sunlight.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: It's worse than I imagined.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: How can you tell, exactly?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: I've never seen anything so brutally ordinary.</p>
    <p>A lab-coated Scientist stands up at the foot of the table.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Scientist</span>: The zombie disease eliminates consciousness without changing the brain in any way. We've been trying to understand how the disease is transmitted. Our conclusion is that, since the disease attacks dual properties of ordinary matter, it must, itself, operate outside our universe. We're dealing with an <em>epiphenomenal virus</em>.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Are you sure?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Scientist</span>: As sure as we can be in the total absence of evidence.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: All right. Compile a report on every epiphenomenon ever observed. What, where, and who. I want a list of everything that hasn't happened in the last fifty years.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: If the virus is epiphenomenal, how do we know it exists?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Scientist</span>: The same way we know we're conscious.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: Oh, okay.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Have the doctors made any progress on finding an epiphenomenal cure?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Scientist</span>: They've tried every placebo in the book. No dice. Everything they do has an effect.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Have you brought in a homeopath?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Scientist</span>: I tried, sir! I couldn't find any!</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Excellent. And the Taoists?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Scientist</span>: They refuse to do anything!</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Then we may yet be saved.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: What about David Chalmers? Shouldn't he be here?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Chalmers… was one of the first victims.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: Oh no.</p>
    <p>(<em>Cut</em> to the interior of a cell, completely walled in by reinforced glass, where David Chalmers paces back and forth.)</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Doctor</span>: David! David Chalmers! Can you hear me?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Chalmers</span>: Yes.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Nurse</span>: It's no use, doctor.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Chalmers</span>: I'm perfectly fine. I've been introspecting on my consciousness, and I can't detect any difference. I <em>know</em> I would be expected to say that, but—</p>
    <p>The Doctor turns away from the glass screen in horror.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Doctor</span>: His words, they… they <em>don't mean anything</em>.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Chalmers</span>: This is a grotesque distortion of my philosophical views. This sort of thing can't actually happen!</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Doctor</span>: Why not?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Nurse</span>: Yes, why not?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Chalmers</span>: Because—</p>
    <p>(Cut to two Police Officers, guarding a dirt road leading up to the imposing steel gate of a gigantic concrete complex. On their uniforms, a badge reads Bridging Law Enforcement Agency.)</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 1</span>: You've got to watch out for those clever bastards. They look like humans. They can talk like humans. They're identical to humans on the atomic level. But they're not human.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 2</span>: Scumbags.</p>
    <p>The huge noise of a throbbing engine echoes over the hills. Up rides the Man on a white motorcycle. The Man is wearing black sunglasses and a black leather business suit with a black leather tie and silver metal boots. His white beard flows in the wind. He pulls to a halt in front of the gate.</p>
    <p>The Officers bustle up to the motorcycle.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 1</span>: State your business here.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Man</span>: Is this where you're keeping David Chalmers?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 2</span>: What's it to you? You a friend of his?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Man</span>: Can't say I am. But even zombies have rights.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 1</span>: All right, buddy, let's see your qualia.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Man</span>: I don't have any.</p>
    <p>Officer 2 suddenly pulls a gun, keeping it trained on the Man.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 2</span>: Aha! A zombie!</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 1</span>: No, zombies claim to have qualia.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 2</span>: So he's an ordinary human?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 1</span>: No, they also claim to have qualia.</p>
    <p>The Officers look at the Man, who waits calmly.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 2</span>: Um…</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 1</span>: Who <em>are</em> you?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Man</span>: I'm Daniel Dennett, bitches.</p>
    <p>Seemingly from nowhere, Dennett pulls a sword and slices Officer 2's gun in half with a steely noise. Officer 1 begins to reach for his own gun, but Dennett is suddenly standing behind Officer 1 and chops with a fist, striking the junction of Officer 1's shoulder and neck. Officer 1 drops to the ground.</p>
    <p>Officer 2 steps back, horrified.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Officer 2</span>: That's not possible! How'd you do that?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Dennett</span>: I am one with my body.</p>
    <p>Dennett drops Officer 2 with another blow, and strides toward the gate.</p>
    <p>He looks up at the imposing concrete complex, and grips his sword tighter.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Dennett</span> <em>(quietly to himself)</em>: There is a spoon.</p>
    <p>(Cut back to General Fred and the other military officials.)</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: I've just received the reports. We've lost Detroit.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: I don't want to be the one to say "Good riddance," but—</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: Australia has been… <em>reduced to atoms</em>.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: The epiphenomenal virus is spreading faster. Civilization itself threatens to dissolve into total normality. We could be looking at the middle of humanity.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: Can we negotiate with the zombies?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: We've sent them messages. They sent only a single reply.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: Which was…?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: It's on its way now.</p>
    <p>An orderly brings in an envelope, and hands it to General Fred.</p>
    <p>General Fred opens the envelope, takes out a single sheet of paper, and reads it.</p>
    <p>Silence envelops the room.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Captain Mudd</span>: What's it say?</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">General Fred</span>: It says… that we're the ones with the virus. (A silence falls.)</p>
    <p>Colonel Todd raises his hands and stares at them.</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: My God, it's true. It's true. I…</p>
    <p>(A tear rolls down Colonel Todd's cheek.)</p>
    <p><span className="smallCaps">Colonel Todd</span>: I don't feel anything.</p>
    <p>The screen goes black.</p>
    <p>The sound goes silent.</p>
    <p>The movie continues exactly as before.</p>
