    <blockquote>
      <p>… Do not all charms fly  <br />
        At the mere touch of cold philosophy?  <br />
        There was an awful rainbow once in heaven:  <br />
        We know her woof, her texture; she is given  <br />
        In the dull catalogue of common things.</p>
      <p>—John Keats, <em>Lamia</em></p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Nothing is “mere.”</p>
      <p>—Richard Feynman</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span className="dropCap tall">Y</span>ou’ve got to admire that phrase, “dull catalogue of common things.” What is it, exactly, that goes in this catalogue? Besides rainbows, that is?</p>
    <p>Why, things that are mundane, of course. Things that are normal; things that are unmagical; things that are known, or knowable; things that play by the rules (or that play by <em>any</em> rules, which makes them boring); things that are part of the ordinary universe; things that are, in a word, <em>real</em>.</p>
    <p>Now that’s what I call setting yourself up for a fall.</p>
    <p>At that rate, sooner or later you’re going to be disappointed in <em>everything</em>—either it will turn out not to exist, or even worse, it will turn out to be real.</p>
    <p>If we cannot take joy in things that are merely real, our lives will <em>always</em> be empty.</p>
    <p>For what sin are rainbows demoted to the dull catalogue of common things? For the sin of having a scientific explanation. “We know her woof, her texture,” says Keats—an interesting use of the word “we,” because I suspect that Keats didn’t know the explanation himself. I suspect that just being told that someone else knew was too much for him to take. I suspect that just the notion of rainbows being scientifically explicable <em>in principle</em> would have been too much to take. And if Keats didn’t think like that, well, I know plenty of people who do.</p>
    <p>I have already remarked that nothing is <em>inherently</em> mysterious—nothing that actually exists, that is. If I am ignorant about a phenomenon, that is a fact about my state of mind, not a fact about the phenomenon; to worship a phenomenon because it seems so wonderfully mysterious is to worship your own ignorance; a blank map does not correspond to a blank territory, it is just somewhere we haven’t visited yet, etc., etc…</p>
    <p>Which is to say that <em>everything</em>—everything that <em>actually</em> exists—is liable to end up in “the dull catalogue of common things,” sooner or later.</p>
    <p>Your choice is either:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Decide that things are allowed to be unmagical, knowable, scientifically explicable—in a word, <em>real</em>—and yet still worth caring about;</li>
      <li>Or go about the rest of your life suffering from existential ennui that is <em>unresolvable</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>(Self-deception might be an option for others, but not for you.)</p>
    <p>This puts quite a different complexion on the bizarre habit indulged by those strange folk called <em>scientists</em>, wherein they suddenly become fascinated by pocket lint or bird droppings or rainbows, or some other ordinary thing which world-weary and sophisticated folk would never give a second glance.</p>
    <p>You might say that scientists—at least <em>some</em> scientists—are those folk who are <em>in principle</em> capable of enjoying life in the real universe.</p>
